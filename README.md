# Quantum Evolve

This project is a frivolous experiment in the use of genetic algorithms in performing quantum algorithm design. At time
of writing,the package is in an early stage of development.

## Testing

Run `make test` (or `go test -v ./...` if preferred).

## Building

Run `make build` or see the Makefile for relevant commands. The binary should be created at `./quantum-evolve`.
